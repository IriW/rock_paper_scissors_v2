# rock_paper_scissors_v2
Different approach in coading Rock-Paper-Scissors game<br>

The final output doesn't really differ from the first version here https://github.com/IriW/rock_paper_scissors_game, but the logic behind it differs resulting the same user experience with less code.<br>
The user should type '0' for Rock, '1' for Paper or '2' for Scissors. Computer randomly choses one of those 3 values too.  <br>
Rock, Paper and Scissors build the list from which both user and computer chose. <br>
Values other then 0-2 are not valid and give an error.

Here's how it works
